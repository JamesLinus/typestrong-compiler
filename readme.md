TypeStrong Compiler
===================

This is a prototype for a promise-based TypeScript compiler (tsc) adapter.

The goal is for this module to eventually be used by grunt-ts and any other future TypeStrong task runner plugins.

Setup
-----
Run `npm install` and `tsd reinstall -so`.

Build
-----
Run `npm run build`.  If successful, the build command should take just a moment and will return no output.

Test
----
Run `npm run test`.  This will run the nodeunit tests.
